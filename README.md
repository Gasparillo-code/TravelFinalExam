In designing this layout, I wanted to create a smooth and visually engaging experience that feels both professional and inviting. I used a clean, vertically structured layout with a sticky navigation bar to make sure users can easily access important links at any time, whether they’re on desktop or mobile. I placed a full-screen hero section right below the header to immediately capture attention and set a travel-inspired tone. I also chose to organize the content in clear, scrollable sections so users can navigate effortlessly from one area to another—such as the featured destinations, the carousel, and the contact form—without feeling overwhelmed.

For the design style, I chose a soft, modern color palette with a deep navy primary color to convey reliability and professionalism. The steel blue secondary color adds a calm, friendly tone, while the soft teal tertiary color brings a refreshing, travel-related vibe. These colors work together to maintain a consistent visual identity and help highlight important elements without clashing. I also added simple animations like fade-ins and hover effects to give the site a more dynamic feel and keep users engaged as they scroll. Overall, I wanted the site to feel clean, approachable, and easy to use—while still reflecting the spirit of adventure and exploration.
